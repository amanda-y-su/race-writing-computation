# Overview of Replication Paper 

The authors of the paper "Race, Writing, and Computation: Racial Difference and the US Novel, 1880-2000" seek to implement a computational study of race that explores how computation can present new opportunities for thinking about racial difference and its  patterns and regularities at scale. They develop a case study that focuses on race, religion, and the United States novel and build a model that tests if novelists marked as “white” versus “black” produce different narratological effects with respect to the interaction of race and religious authority, in particular, the authority of the Bible. In simpler terms, do writers identified as racially different contextualize the Bible in different ways in their novels? Then, the authors identify a set of general patterns in these effects that they interpret through the model’s reliance on concrete categories of racial identity. The ultimate aim of this is to propose a method for deforming this very categorical thinking. The authors' logistic regression model reveals the relationship of race, gender, and biblical citation to the “sociality” of contexts where the Bible is quoted. That is, they model the relationship between the “Bible” and “race” variables to determine what are the odds of a Bible context being “social” increases or decreases based on the race variable, the options being "white" or "black." For the purposes of this paper, moments of sociality, are defined as the presence of two or more characters engaged in dialogue or interaction. The question at hand is how a writer's identity as "white" or "black" significantly changes the likelihood that the scene of their citation of the Bible in their work is “social”. The study ultimately finds that when a white writer quotes the Bible, it is less likely that she/he quotes it in a social context compared to when she/he writes about non-Bible related topics. However, when a black writer quotes the Bible, it is more likely that she/he quotes it in a social context.
